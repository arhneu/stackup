# NES R.O.B. Stack-up Replacement parts

Created and maintained by arhn.eu

R.O.B. the robot was an accessory for the Nintendo Entertainment System released in 1985. The toy came bundled with the game Gyromite as well as a bunch of accessories used to play the game.

Less common is "Stack-Up", a separate game with its own accessories which required to be purchased separately. The set consisted of the game cartridge, a set of 5 colored "blocks", 5 stand pieces to install in the R.O.B. base and two hand grip attachments.

What's included in this project:

block-v1.stl
The block piece. Print 5 of these in following colors: blue, red, green, yellow, white.
rob-base-v4.stl
The base pieces. Print 5 in white/pearl color for best effect.
This project is an attempt at creating replacement parts for R.O.B. Currently blocks and stands are available with the grips arriving shortly. These can be easily temporarily replaced with a piece of sponge and a couple rubbber bands.

Parts are designed to be printable without supports or rafts but some printers may need supports for the angled stand pieces.

I used a DaVinci Jr. to print my samples and they work perfect, but some adjustments might be required for different brands. For my settings please check the "Print Settings" box.

The original R.O.B. blocks weigh around 8-9 grams. The replacements, as printed with my settings weigh about 12 g. This doesn't seem to affect the operation of ROB but if your robot struggles to lift the entire weight of all the blocks, try reducing the infill.
